                In the continent of Laeshyn, the land of Kragnahr has taken over large sums of the
                Western continent. With Kragnahr ruling the country with iron fist and adding
                policies like no half-bloods, resistance is sure to rise. Resistances come in
                different shapes and forms. Terrorism, diplomatic politics, saving those in need
                and anything in between. This is where you come in. You will be forced to make
                choices about how to most effectively deal with this. So how will YOU do it?

                You used to be an ordinary animal... you think... And you had to deal with the
                balance of the jungle and life and theath scenarios on a daily basis. Then, one day
                you saw the light. Not only you, but every creature in the animal kingdom did.
                Now everyone has mutated into what looks like humans crossed with animals, and
                everyone is suddenly intelligent! You decide to band up with a party to learn more about
                this light. Maybe there resides even more power in there than originally perceived?
